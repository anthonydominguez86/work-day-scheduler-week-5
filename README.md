# The Assignment: Work Day Scheduler

*WHEN I open the planner

*THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

*WHEN I scroll down

*THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours

*WHEN I view the time blocks for that day

*THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

*WHEN I click into a time block

*THEN I can enter an event

*WHEN I click the save button for that time block

*THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

*WHEN I refresh the page

*THEN the saved events persist

This assignment was the first one that gave us an in depth starter CSS file it had all the styling given we had to add the elements in html and make them work. This starter CSS was very helpful and I was glad it was there it gave me a better undertanding of what was happening and how all the files work together simultaneously to complete the above assignment requirements. The assignment was to make a day planner and have it also save the input to local storage so when the file was opened again the input would still be displayed so a person can reference it for the next day or be reminded of tasks that had previously been completed. This assignment proved to be one that was challenging but it also taught me how to utilize the local storage to save data for future reference. 

# Lessons:

This assignment taught me alot about pulling in other resources like moment.js and utilizing then to complete the requirements. Also this wa sthe first assigment that we were allowed to used jquery which was also a great resource. a big lesson that I took away from this is the way it made the java file much more concise to complete the same requirements. Jquery took what would have probably been 100 or more lines of code and reduced it to almost half of what it would have been with just plain java. I also learned local storage and its uses as well as it advantages of being able to access saved information at any time. 

# Takaways:

This assignment showed me the use of jquery, local storage, and moment.js. I also realized how they all work together to make a more dynamic and user friendly webpage. a webpage the user can not only interact with but utilize as a tool for their success. All people could use a little more organization in their life and being able to write down and schedule your day hour to hour and also access that data for later use or maybe to look back on it for reference.
