# The Assignment: Work Day Scheduler

*WHEN I open the planner

*THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

*WHEN I scroll down

*THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours

*WHEN I view the time blocks for that day

*THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

*WHEN I click into a time block

*THEN I can enter an event

*WHEN I click the save button for that time block

*THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

*WHEN I refresh the page

*THEN the saved events persist

This assignment was the first one that gave us an in depth starter CSS file it had all the styling given we had to add the elements in html and make them work. This starter CSS was very helpful and I was glad it was there it gave me a better undertanding of what was happening and how all the files work together simultaneously to complete the above assignment requirements. The assignment was to make a day planner and have it also save the input to local storage so when the file was opened again the input would still be displayed so a person can reference it for the next day or be reminded of tasks that had previously been completed. This assignment proved to be one that was challenging but it also taught me how to utilize the local storage to save data for future reference.
